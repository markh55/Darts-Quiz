## Deyployment

Repository

• I made a public local repository on my Github account, I then linked my repository to my Gitpod account and started building.
When writing my code I ensured that I committed my changes to the repository using clear and direct messages for any changes,this is done by doing the following in the terminal;

git add .
git commit -m “Enter message here”
git push

I would send a commit after each change then I would push the file once i made 3 or 4 changes.

Hosting

This is how I hosted my website: On Github I Selected my Repository (Darts-Quiz), then I would go to;

Settings
Pages

Once on the pages site I would ensure the following settings were applied; Source would need to be set to ‘Deploy from branch’ Branch will need to be set to main and then
root. Save.
